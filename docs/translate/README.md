This project is part of the Data Analysis and Big Data course, taught by Professor Jorge Werner.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to clean data from a set of Spotify songs, preparing them for further analysis. The data was cleaned based on my interpretation of each variable in the Spotify API Documentation, available [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features).

## Required Libraries

To run the project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

-   pandas
-   openpyxl
-   numpy

You can install the dependencies using the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Make sure the dependencies are installed.
3. Run the script.py script in the terminal.

Ensure that the input CSV file is in the `data/` directory, and the output Excel file will be generated in the `out/` directory.
